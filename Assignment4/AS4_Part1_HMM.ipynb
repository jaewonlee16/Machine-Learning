What we would like to do instead is have the HMM learn to model the data on its own. And while it is possible to use supervised learning with an HMM (by hard-coding the emission model or the transition model) so that the states have a particular interpretation, the really cool thing about HMMs is that they are naturally unsupervised learners, so they can learn to use their different states to represent different patterns in the data, without the programmer needing to indicate what each state means."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8K471fT4N-PR"},"source":["Like many machine learning models, an HMM can be trained using maximum likelihood estimation, i.e.:\n","\n","$$\\theta^* = \\underset{\\theta}{\\text{argmin }} -\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}^i}\\text{log }p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x}^i)$$\n","\n","where $\\mathbf{x}^1, \\mathbf{x}^2, \\dots$ are training examples.\n","\n","The standard method for doing this is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which for HMMs is also called the \"Baum-Welch\" algorithm. In EM training, we alternate between an \"E-step\", where we estimate the values of the latent variables, and an \"M-step\", where the model parameters are updated given the estimated latent variables. (Think $k$-means, where you guess which cluster each data point belongs to, then reestimate where the clusters are, and repeat.) The EM algorithm has some nice properties: it is guaranteed at each step to decrease the loss function, and the E-step and M-step may have an exact closed form solution, in which case no pesky learning rates are required.\n","\n","But because the HMM forward algorithm is differentiable with respect to all the model parameters, we can also just take advantage of automatic differentiation methods in libraries like PyTorch and try to minimize $-\\text{log }p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$ directly, by backpropagating through the forward algorithm and running stochastic gradient descent. That means we don't need to write any additional HMM code to implement training: `loss.backward()` is all you need."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aVh0-369qZDC"},"source":["Here we will implement SGD training for an HMM in PyTorch.
